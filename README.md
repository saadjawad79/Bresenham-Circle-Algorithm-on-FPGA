# Bresenham-Circle-Algorithm-on-FPGA
Bresenham Algorithms for Line and Circle are popular algorithms used in primitive pixel drawing in computer graphics. It is efficient and easily implementable on hardware. The results of the FPGA Algorithm are displayed on a monitor using VGA Adapter. The VGA Adapter IP Core for the DE1-SoC is at https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece241_07F/vga/
